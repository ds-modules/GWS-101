    "Objects are used everywhere when you're coding - even when you dont know it. But what really is an object? \n",
    "\n",
    "By definition, an object is an **instance** of a **class**. They're an **abstraction**, so they can be used to manipulate data. That sounds complicated, doesn't it? Well, to simplify, think of this: a class is a huge general category of something which holds particular attributes (variables) and actions (functions). Let's assume that Mars has aliens called Xelhas and one of them visits Earth. The Xelha species would be a class, and the alien itself would be an *instance* of that class (or an object). By observing its behavior and mannerisms, we would be able to see how the rest of its species goes about doing things.\n",

    "Strings are objects too, of the *String* class, which has pre-defined methods that we use. But you don't need to worry about that yet. All you should know is that strings are **not** \"primitive\" data types, such as integers or booleans. That being said, let's delve right in.\n",

As mentioned before, Strings are not primitive data types, like integers and booleans, so when you try to **add** a string to an integer, Python gets confused and throws an error. The important thing to note here is that a String is a String: no matter what its contents may be. If it's between two quotes, it has to be a String. \n",
